# Hello 

I'm Ryan (@ryanlundqvist). I'm a CS undergraduate at Georgia Tech, and I am interested in software engineering, applications of computing research, and math. I'm also an American and Swedish citizen and love to code, use hobby electronics, and study reptiles. 

 I'm looking for Summer 2024 internships, and I can be reached at ryan.lundqvist@icloud.com
