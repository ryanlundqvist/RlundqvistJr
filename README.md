# Hi there! 

I'm Ryan (@ryanlundqvist). I'm a CS student (formerly EE) at Georgia Tech 🐝 (Concentration: AI & Devices) and am interested in learning about robotics, machine learning, human-computer interaction/biometric interfaces, and web development. I'm also an American and Swedish citizen and a big fan of snakes, and have been photographing and finding reptiles/amphibians as an amateur herpetologist for as long as I can remember (my pet carpet python is in my pfp)! 🐍

I'm currently working part-time at the Expressive Machinery Lab and Smithsonian National Air & Space (remote), and doing some cool
stuff with biometrics as a part of CREATE-X. I'm looking for Summer 2023 internships, and I can be reached at rlundqvist3@gatech.edu.

### __I haven't publicly saved most of my previous work to GitHub in the past, because it has been forbidden to do so (work projects, school projects, etc...), but may be uploading some fun projects here going forward!__
