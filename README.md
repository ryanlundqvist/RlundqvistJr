ðŸŽ“ I'm a Computer Science student at Georgia Tech, concentrating in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning. I am interested in machine learning engineering, data infrastructure, applications of computing research, and mathematics.

ðŸ’» Professionally, I am a software engineer with experience in an intersection of backend, data, and machine learning. Previously, I worked at Amazon on Elastic Cloud Compute.

ðŸ”¬ I'm also interested in computing research! Currently, I'm working on creating fingerspelling sign language recognition models for the PopSignAI application, in partnership with Google Accessibility Research. Previously, I worked on the SnakeCLEF competition, created models for recognizing snake species and being published in CLEF2024. I also worked for a period on platforms for generative AI research.
