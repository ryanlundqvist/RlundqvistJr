# Hi there! 

I'm Ryan (@ryanlundqvist). I'm a CS student at Georgia Tech and am interested in software engineering and research engineering. I'm also an American and Swedish citizen and love to code, use hobby electronics, and study reptiles. I have been photographing and finding reptiles/amphibians as an amateur herpetologist for as long as I can remember (my pet carpet python is in my pfp) 🐍

 I'm looking for Summer 2024 internships, and I can be reached at rlundqvist3@gatech.edu.
